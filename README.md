# About

This is a lightweight Docker image used for GitLab CI/CD runners, originally created for catching terraform lint/fmt errors ([CPT-374](https://mintel.atlassian.net/browse/CPT-374)).

Please keep this image as small as possible. If you need a more robust image, consider [satoshi-gitops-ci](https://hub.docker.com/r/mintel/satoshi-gitops-ci) or creating a new image for your use case.

## Alpine

This image uses [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/), a lightweight distribution created to lower the size of Docker images.

# Usage

# Resources
